## Overview

In this lesson, we'll learn how to utilize `properties` or `props` for short to create reusable elements in React. `Props` allow our components to change dymanically based on information that we provide in a quite familiar syntax!

## Getting Started

- Fork and Clone
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

## What are `props`?

> “Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.
> But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)
> Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.

In short, `props` are pieces of information that we can provide to any component in a `downward` direction (We'll talk about this shortly). `Props` can be any information we want whether that be `strings`, `objects`, `arrays` or `functions`.

## Prop Syntax

`Props` follow a very simple convention:

</div>
